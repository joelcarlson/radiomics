##TODO

(COMPLETE? - increased speed drastically, still includes a for loop) GLRLM is, in general, incredibly slow.
    particularly for 45 and 135 degrees
    
(COMPLETE) GLRLM and GLCM use different notation for angle (GLCM = shift, GLRLM=angle)

(COMPLETE) grey level messages are annoying, add an option to remove verbosity

(COMPLETE) Allow discretizeImage to handle NAs

(WIP) Add tests 

implement fuzzyGLCM (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39646-5_18)

(COMPLETE) Add warning to discretizeImage when creating more gray levels than occur in the image (leads to banding in the GLCM) 

(COMPLETE) Add documentation

(COMPLETE) Add image methods for matrices

Optimize MGLSZM definition

Vectorize GLCM features

(DEPRECATED) Create an option within calc_features() to store the calculated matrices

Add references to publications

Allow handling of negative value (maybe)

Use C++ for main loops in GLCM, GLRLM, GLZM, and MGLSZM

Use C++ for main loops in feature calculations (and benchmark speeds) 

C++ tests
