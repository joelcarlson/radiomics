##TODO

(COMPLETE? - increased speed drastically, still includes a for loop) GLRLM is, in general, incredibly slow.
    particularly for 45 and 135 degrees
    
GLRLM and GLCM use different notation for angle (GLCM = shift, GLRLM=angle)

(COMPLETE) grey level messages are annoying, add an option to remove verbosity

Allow discretizeImage to handle NAs

(WIP) Add tests 

implement fuzzyGLCM (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39646-5_18)

Don't forget to add base R first order stats into final function!

(COMPLETE) Add warning to discretizeImage when creating more gray levels than occur in the image (leads to banding in the GLCM) 

Add documentation
