## Release summary

This release, most importantly, added generator functions for the matrix classes. Without these the user had to use new("glcm", data), which is not ideal.
Apologies for the fast re-release (~1 week), there were some issues that needed to be addressed due to this being my first CRAN submission.

## Test environments

* local Ubuntu 14.04 LTS install, R 3.2.2
* win-builder 

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTES, ERRORs or WARNINGs.
