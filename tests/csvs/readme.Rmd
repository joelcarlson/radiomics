You might be asking yourself "What are all of these files and folders?"

Well, surely interested reader, in preparation for converting the 'heavy lifting' parts of the algorithms to C++, I wanted to save confirmed matrices to make sure I don't accidentally break anything. As the algorithms are hand confirmed by myself to be working at this time, I am saving the outputs now.

It's impractical for me to type the values into testthat expectations, so I've saved them all as .csv files. 

These will only be on github, CRAN would probably complain about the size, we'll see.

They were produced simply, as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Matrices
for(angle in c(0,45,90,135)){
  write.table(glcm(hallbey, angle=angle, v=F)@.Data, paste0("hb", angle,".csv"), sep=",")
  write.table(glcm(tumor, angle=angle, v=F)@.Data, paste0("tumor", angle,".csv"), sep=",")
  write.table(glcm(bars, angle=angle, v=F)@.Data, paste0("bars", angle,".csv"), sep=",")
  write.table(glcm(noise, angle=angle, v=F)@.Data, paste0("noise", angle,".csv"), sep=",")
}

#Features
for(angle in c(0,45,90,135)){
  write.table(calc_features(glcm(hallbey, angle=angle)), paste0("hb", angle,".csv"), sep=",", row.names=FALSE)
  write.table(calc_features(glcm(tumor, angle=angle)), paste0("tumor", angle,".csv"), sep=",", row.names=FALSE)
  write.table(calc_features(glcm(bars, angle=angle)), paste0("bars", angle,".csv"), sep=",", row.names=FALSE)
  write.table(calc_features(glcm(noise, angle=angle)), paste0("noise", angle,".csv"), sep=",", row.names=FALSE)
}
```

That's all, really! Let's speed up some algorithms!
